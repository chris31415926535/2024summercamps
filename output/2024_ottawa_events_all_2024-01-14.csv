aware of any diagnosed or undiagnosed cognitive differences or behaviours your
child may have early on. Making us aware early on will help our coordinators
arrange for any additional supports that may be needed. If your child requires
integration support at school, please contact the Inclusive Recreation team at
InclusiveRecreation-LoisirsInclusifs@ottawa.ca. 1:1 Shared Care support can be
offered at no cost for 2 weeks. Please be advised that Shared Care is based on
a first-come, first-served basis. Please reach out early to secure your spot
and allow enough time for the intake process prior to the start of camp. Camp
participation criteria will be used to determine eligibility for Shared Care
support.</p></div>",https://ca.apm.activecommunities.com/ottawa/Activity_Search/swim-explorer/75687,32,13,0,0,8,"Age at least 8 yrs but less than 13 yrs,","Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri",8:00 AM - 5:00 PM,2024-07-29,2024-08-02,29 July 2024 to 2 August 2024,81094,8:00 AM - 5:00 PM
