inclusion of all campers. To best support children at camp, please make us
aware of any diagnosed or undiagnosed cognitive differences or behaviours your

arrange for any additional supports that may be needed. If your child requires
integration support at school, please contact the Inclusive Recreation team at

offered at no cost for 2 weeks. Please be advised that Shared Care is based on
